This is a copy of the group repo for group29's final project for COGS108 in fall 2019.

The team members are Brian, Will, Nancy, Sydney and Ana. 

We wanted to find whether there was a correlation between the location of car accidents and road conditions.

We used data from data.sandiego.gov and Google's Geocoding API to find latitude/longitude pairs of every accident in San Diego during 2015 and the road conditions of named roads in San Diego in 2015. Then, we mapped each accident to a road using the haversine formula and found there was no correlation between road conditions and the location of car accidents. In San Diego, during the year 2015, it was as likely as to get into a car accident in a well-maintained road as a road with potholes and cracking.

A detailed explanation of our methodology, results and code can be found in the following pdf:
